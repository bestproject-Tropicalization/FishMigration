## Fish larval dispersal and changing thermal boundaries along the Australian Eastern seaboard.

### Hypothesis
Geographic larval dispersal is dependent upon optimal thermal boundaries and currents.

### Project Objective:
We intend to explore the geographic range that could be inhabited by tropical vagrant fishes under the changing landscape of climate change, on the New South Wales coastline. Identifying the zones that represent viable conditions for warm-water species may inform conservation efforts aimed at mitigating the tropicalisation of temperate systems as well as defining key refuges resilient from the impacts of climate change, which will lead to more successful management programs.  

### Data:
We analyse data from the CSIRO BRAN 2020 dataset. It provides daily data for ocean currents, temperature and salinity at various depths from 1993 to present. We also analyse sampled fish populations at various research stations from the IMOS Database of Marine Larval Fish Assemblages, which  focuses on Australian temperate and subtropical waters from 1983 to present date.


### Planned Analysis

__1. Create aggregated time series models of key variables across 10 years (2013 - 2022) designed to track:__
- potential geographic threshold for tropical vagrant sustainability, and
- identify the southernmost broad geographic range in which key variables are suitable for sustaining fish larvae recruitment and overwintering periods.

_Data folder: Climate Variables (Temp, Salinity)_

__2. Plot ocean current anomalies to detect anomalies over a decadal time frame (2011 - 2022)__

_Data folder: Ocean Current (Anomaly Plot)_

__3. Generate aggregate plot of ‘Chaetodontidae’ (Butterfly Fish) - a primary study group for tropicalised systems - detection and abundance at research stations along NSW coast__

_Data folder: Fish Locations (Sampled)_

__4. Analyse fish larval dispersion using Ocean Parcels to model dispersal within larval spawning (October - December 2021) and recruitment (January to May 2022) time periods.__
